## Code Review
---
### Reviewer

Understand why the change is necessary (fixes a bug, improves the user experience, refactors the 
existing code). Then:
- Create a checklist for yourself of the things that the code reviews tend to focus on
	- Checklist for Reviewer
- Critique code instead of people â€“ be kind to the coder, not to the code.
- Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience
- Communicate which ideas you feel strongly about and those you don't.
- Please note that Review meetings are **NOT** problem solving meetings.
- If discussions turn too philosophical or academic, move the discussion offline to a regular Friday afternoon technique discussion. In the meantime, let the author make the final decision on alternative implementations.
- Remember that there is often more than one way to approach a solution
- Offer alternative implementations, but assume the author already considered them. ("What do you think about using a custom validator here?")
- Seek to understand the author's perspective.
- Make sure you have good coding standards to reference
- Don't rush through a code review - but also, you need to do it promptly. Remember your coworkers are waiting for you.
- Remember to praise.
- Sign off on the pull request with a :+1: or "Ready to merge" comment.
