 # Code Review
---

A Guide for everyone while reviewing code.

## Everyone
- Accept that many programming decisions are opinions. Discuss tradeoffs, which you prefer, and reach a resolution quickly.
- Ask questions; don't make demands. ("What do you think about naming this :user_id?")
- Ask for clarification by mentioning the points you didn't understand.("I didn't understand what you mean by good naming conventions, please can you clarify?")
- Before asking questions, summerize what you have understand and then ask questions.
- Avoid selective ownership of code. ("mine", "not mine", "yours")
- Avoid using abusive words and terms that could be seen as referring to personal traits. ("dumb", "stupid"). 
- Be explict in what you want to say. Remember people don't always understand your intentions.
- Be humble. ("I'm not sure - let's look it up.")
- Don't use hyperbole. ("always", "never", "endlessly", "nothing")
- Don't use sarcasm.
- Keep it real. If emoji, animated gifs, or humor aren't you, don't force them. If they are, use them with aplomb.
- if there are too many "I didn't understand" or "Alternative solution:" comments on pull request.
Take the conversion were you can talk synchronously (e.g. chat, screensharing, in person) 
- Post a follow-up comment summarizing the discussion and what was concluded.
