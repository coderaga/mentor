## Why to Review Code ?

The code runs then why, why, why should code be reviewed...

Here are the main goals of code review:

1. To spot and fix defects early in the process.
2. Better-shared understanding of the code base as team members learn from each other
3. Helps to maintain a level of consistency in design and implementation.
4. Helps to identify common defects across the team thus reducing rework.
5. Builds confidence of stakeholders about technical quality of the execution.
6. Uniformity in understanding will help interchangeability of team members in case of non-availability of any one of them.
7. A different perspective. “Another set of eyes” adds objectivity. Similar to the reason for separating your coding and testing teams, peer reviews provide the distance needed to recognize problems.
8. Pride/reward. Recognition of coding prowess is a significant reward for many programmers.
9. Team cohesiveness. Working together helps draw team members closer. It also provides a brief respite from the isolation that coding often brings.

### The main areas a reviewer is focusing on are as follows:

- General Unit Testing
- Comment and Coding Conventions
- Error Handling
- Resource Leaks
- Thread Safety
- Control Structures
- Performance
- Functionality
- Security
