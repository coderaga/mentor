## Best Object Oriented Design Practices

There are many, many Object Oriented Design Practices, but ther are some general common principle's
everyone should follow are

- Avoid global variables.
- Avoid long parameter lists.
- Limit collaborators of an object (entities an object depends on).
- Limit an object's dependencies (entities that depend on an object).
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Prefer small methods. Between one and five lines is best.
- Prefer small classes with a single, well-defined responsibility. When a class exceeds 100 lines, it may be doing too many things.
- [Tell, don't ask](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/27572137956/tell-dont-ask "Tell, don't ask").

## Popular Object Oriented Design Principles are:
1. [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID "SOLID") an acronym for
	- [Single Responsibility Principal (SRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle "Single Responsibility Principal (SRP)")
    - [Open/closed principle (OCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle "Open/closed principle (OCP)")
    - [Liskov substitution principle (LSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle "Liskov substitution principle (LSP)")
    - [Interface segregation principle (ISP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle "Interface segregation principle (ISP)")
    - [Dependency inversion principle (DIP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle "Dependency inversion principle (DIP)")
