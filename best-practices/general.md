## General Practices

General practices to follow while coding
- Practices are not to be blindly followed; strive to understand these and ask when in doubt.
- Don't duplicate the functionality of a built-in library.
- Don't swallow exceptions or "fail silently."
- Don't write code that guesses at future functionality.
- Exceptions should be exceptional.
- Keep the code simple and readable.
